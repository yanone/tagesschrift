Tagesschrift (“day-font”) is the result of a one-day type design experiment. It was written with a broad-nib pen, digitized, and adjusted all in a single day. The mixture of the quirky but still traditional appearance of this casual Antiqua suggests Tagesschrift to be used in a broad range of packaging and advertising applications.
